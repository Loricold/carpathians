      <p>
        The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians are a range of mountains forming
        an arc across Central Europe. Roughly 1,500 km (930 mi) long, it is the
        third-longest European mountain range after the Urals at 2,500 km (1,600
        mi) and the Scandinavian Mountains at 1,700 km (1,100 mi). They provide
        habitat for the largest European populations of brown bears, wolves,
        chamois, and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania, as well
        as over one-third of all European plant species. The mountains and their
        foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having
        one-third of the European total.
